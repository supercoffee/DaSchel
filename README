The history file ".ssh_history" will be created in the pwd upon successful exit. 

No more than 200 commands will be saved into the history file. 

Quirks:
	If the history file is removed via "rm" while inside the shell,
	 it will be recreated upon shell exit. 
	
	The shell only supports redirecting a file once.
	Multiple redirects result in undefined behavior.
